In other words, drivers that are baked into the operating system rather than dynamically loaded by NVIDIA\'s GPU Operator. This configuration is highly desirable for customers that want to pre-bake all artefacts required for deployment into the image, and where the dynamic selection of the driver version is not a requirement. This guide shows how to deploy the additional components onto a pre-installed system, but the steps could also be used to create a deployment image with the software pre-baked.","sidebar":"docs"},"misc/cluster-api-concepts":{"id":"misc/cluster-api-concepts","title":"Cluster API core concepts","description":"Intro","sidebar":"docs"},"misc/create-a-simple-container-image-obs":{"id":"misc/create-a-simple-container-image-obs","title":"Create a simple container image based on Tumbleweed using OBS (openSUSE Build Service)","description":"Create the project to host the assets","sidebar":"docs"},"misc/create-a-single-iso-image-customized":{"id":"misc/create-a-single-iso-image-customized","title":"Create a custom single-iso image (using SLE Micro installer and combustion image) to use it on Virtual CD-ROM","description":"The feature to create a single iso (installer image and combustion) to be used by Virtual CD-Rom, will be added to the SLE Micro 5.5 release.","sidebar":"docs"},"misc/metallb-kube-api":{"id":"misc/metallb-kube-api","title":"MetalLB Service in front of the Kubernetes API server","description":"MetalLB in front of the Kubernetes API server","sidebar":"docs"},"misc/modify-sle-micro-iso":{"id":"misc/modify-sle-micro-iso","title":"Modify SLE Micro ISO (or any SLE ISO)","description":"This is totally unsupported.
